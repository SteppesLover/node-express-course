In this lesson, you created a middleware function called asyncWrapper. Why?
The asyncWrapper middleware is used to simplify error handling in async route handlers. It automatically catches rejected promises and passes them to the next() middleware, so we don’t have to write repetitive try/catch blocks in every controller.

Suppose that you want to make sure that both a status code and an error message are sent back to the user when they request the URL for a task that does not exist. Assume that you’ve created a CustomAPIError class and an error handler that references that class. Complete the code:
const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {  
  const { id: taskID } = req.params;  
  const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });  
  if (!task) {  
    return next(createCustomError(`No task with id: ${taskID}`, 404))
  }  
  res.status(200).json({ task });  
});  
As you will see in the lessons that follow, you do not have to always create the asyncWrapper middleware, because you can instead use an NPM package called express-async-errors that provides the same capability.
