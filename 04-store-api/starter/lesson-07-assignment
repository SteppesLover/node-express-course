Have you implemented/used any new strategies since the previous post on how to ask for help? If so what were they and how did they turn out for you?
Not really — to be honest, I’ve been focused on completing the lessons and moving quickly through the assignments, so I haven’t paused much to ask for help yet.
After reading the article what changes (if any) will you make to your strategy?
I'd like to become a more collaborative person — someone who’s comfortable asking for help when needed. Right now, I feel capable of working through things on my own, but I believe that in a real work environment, I’ll naturally become more team-oriented and open to seeking guidance.
What are some ways you can determine which “circle” (inner circle of things you know, middle circle of things you can figure out on your own, outer circle of things you don’t know and can’t learn by yourself) your blocker/bug/issue falls into?
Most of my issues are in the "inner circle" — they just require a closer look at my code and logic. That said, the “middle circle” is expanding thanks to the internet and AI tools, which help me learn and solve problems more effectively. These tools are helping me bridge the gap between what I know and what I’m learning.
